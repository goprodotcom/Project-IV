		<h6>About</h6>
		<p>花火のように is a restaurant aiming to provide guests with the warm, familial environment of an authentic Japanese establishment sans the expensive plane ticket and long plane ticket.</p>
		<h6 id="history">History</h6>
		<p>Founded in 1963 within the back streets of New York, our restaurant has evolved from a simple ramen-ya to a worldwide conglomerate. Mr. Nobu Saotome (早乙女信さん) and his dream came from humble beginnings, but slowly, the success brought on by their above-average cuisine brought attention to one of many small shops on Broadway, and a small ramen-ya became a family-run fast-food place, then a full restaurant, and with time, more cropped up around the United States. 2017, 花火のように is the premiere site for enjoying Japanese food, entertainment, and culture.</p><br>
